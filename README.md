## ðŸš€ Deployment Overview

This application is deployed in a **Kubernetes environment** on the **CIRRUS cloud**.  
Deployment is managed using a **Helm chart**, which resides in a separate repository:

[NCAR/sage-data-commons-dashboard-k8s-dev](https://github.com/NCAR/sage-data-commons-dashboard-k8s-dev)

## Deployment Steps

When code changes are pushed to this repository, **GitHub Actions** automatically build and publish a Docker image to the repositoryâ€™s container registry:

[GitHub Packages â€“ sage-data-commons-dashboard](https://github.com/NCAR/sage-data-commons-dashboard/pkgs/container/sage-data-commons-dashboard)

### 1. Identify the New Artifact Tag
After a successful build, locate the latest image tag â€” for example:

0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-20251007-141304

### 2. Update the Helm Chart
Copy the desired image tag and update the `values.yaml` file in the Helm chart repository:

yaml
container:
  tag: 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-20251007-141304

## Trigger ArgoCD Deployment

Once the `values.yaml` file is updated and committed:

- **ArgoCD** detects the change automatically.  
- It then deploys the new image to the **CIRRUS Kubernetes environment**.

> **Note:**  
> The Helm chart repository is **private**.  
> Authentication is handled via an **SSH Deploy Key pair** configured in the ArgoCD application and the repo.
